# deep-picture-embedding-features
The repository contains the code and notebooks for the tutorials on how to extract embedding features form pictures using the ResNext model. The quality and effectiveness of the techniques is proved by the clustering in the embedding space and the correlation of clusters with their corresponding labels.
